There are several methods based around `ActiveRecord::Calculations#calculate`.

`calculate` takes an operation, a column name, and an options hash similar to `ActiveRecord::FinderMethods#find`. Methods based on `calculate` are shortcuts for different operations, and take a column name and options hash as arguments.

In addition to the vulnerable options listed for `find`, the column name argument can also accept SQL!

Calculation methods:

* average
* calculate
* count
* maximum
* minimum
* sum

Any methods which delete records should be used with care!

The `delete_all` method takes the same kind of conditions arguments as `find`.
The argument can be a string, an array, or a hash of conditions. Strings will not
be escaped at all. Use an array or hash to safely parameterize arguments.

Never pass user input directly to `delete_all`.

Because ActiveRecord needs to insantiate each object, this query is performed in a transaction.
The SQL for selecting the records to delete (where the injection occurs) looks like this:

    :desc => <<-MD
Any methods which delete records should be used with lots of caution! `destroy_all` is only slightly safer
than `delete_all` since it will invoke callbacks associated with the model.

The `destroy_all` method takes the same kind of conditions arguments as `find`.
The argument can be a string, an array, or a hash of conditions. Strings will not
be escaped at all. Use an array or hash to safely parameterize arguments.

Never pass user input directly to `destroy_all`.

    :example => "This is more obvious than the example above, but demonstrates checking another table for a given value.",
    :desc => <<-MD
The `exists?` method is used to check if a given record exists. The argument is usually a primary key. If the argument is a string, it will be escaped. If the argument is an array or hash, it will be treated like a conditions option.

*However*, code like this is *not safe*:

<pre>
<span class="CodeRay"><span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">User</span>.exists? params[<span style="color:#A60">:user</span>]</span>
</pre>

Since Rails will automatically convert parameters to arrays or hashes, it is possible to inject any SQL into this query.

For example,

`?user[]=1`

Will generate the query

<pre>
<span class="CodeRay"><span style="color:#B06;font-weight:bold">SELECT</span>  <span style="color:#00D">1</span> <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">AS</span> one <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">FROM</span> <span style="background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)"><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span><span style="color:#D20">users</span><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span></span>  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">WHERE</span> (<span style="color:#00D">1</span>) LIMIT <span style="color:#00D">1</span></span>
</pre>

This query will always return true. To be be safe, convert user input to a string or integer if using it as the primary key in `exists?`.

The `find` method is a very general and commonly-used query method. The first argument to `find` is either an integer ID, `:all`, `:first`, or `:last`. The last argument is an options hash. The options accepted by `find` are often used in other methods as well.

The first argument to `find` *will* be escaped.

Options:

* `:conditions` - Can be a string, an array, or a hash. If a string, it will be passed to the database unchanged. If an array, the first element is a string and the remaining elements are values to interpolate into the string. The values will be sanitized, but the string element will not. If a hash is given, the keys and values will be properly sanitized.
* `:order` - Unsanitized SQL string for `ORDER BY` clause.
* `:group` - Unsanitized SQL string for `GROUP BY` clause.
* `:having` - Unsanitized SQL string for `HAVING` clause.
* `:limit` - Will be converted to an integer.
* `:offset` - Will be converted to an integer.
* `:joins` - Accepts SQL string, which is not sanitized. Also accepts named associations or an array containing both strings and named associations.
* `:include` - Only accepts named associations.
* `:select` - Unsanitized SQL string `SELECT` clause.
* `:from` - Unsanitized SQL string.
* `:readonly` - Boolean value
* `:lock` - Unsanitized SQL string. May be ignored in databases that do not support locks. Also accepts a boolean.

The `all`, `first`, `last`, `exists`, `where`, `calculate`, `update_all` and other methods accept these options or a subset.
